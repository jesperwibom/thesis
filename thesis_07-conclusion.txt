Conclusion
In this work I have researched the current design effort that target refugees. It has been shown that, on the one hand there is a great rift between NGOs and other organisations understanding about what technology can offer, on the other a naive innovation push from start ups. If this design area continues to be approach as a market opportunity then no real innovation will be achieved.


Anyone going into a project like this expecting to find the homogenous user group “refugees” or “asylum seekers” would stack their odds for success against themselves. This is said knowing that this works title express the same flaw. “How to leverage asylum seekers ability to engage in the asylum evaluation process by increasing accessibility of governmental asylum process guiding documentation” is dangerously close to “How to help refugees using design”.
But the name is not the problem, it is the actions a designer take, or not take as is most common. In this work I have argued that the design context I’ve chosen need to be explored by participation, less observation. The organisations seemingly lack an understanding or practise of innovation and development project, but that the target users most definitely do not.


The final concept developed into an alternative search interface–coupled with an external database (external from Lifos own database)–which could be used by asylum seekers, public counsels and other support persons to find, retrieve, discuss, and save data. 
There is no question that legal processes need expert help. Anyone going through a longer legal process, of any kind, will need guidance from experts. This is the role of a public counsel and the caseworker. That laws and other legal and official documents are not translated into all languages (or other languages at all) is by no means unexpected or troublesome. After all there are expert dedicating their entire lives to understand these laws and processes.
There is, however, a difference to common national laws and documents that exclusively guide processes with non-citizens. Since the quantity and open nature of these documents it is a good opportunity to use machine translation to, at the very least, give the target group some understanding about the process and the ability to actively search through it. It is activity versus passivity. This passivity is today forced upon the asylum applicant and it is very much damaging.
