Design process
Exploration
This phase was about exploring the different opportunities that exists in the design space. I performed desktop research about migration law, participated in several related activities, interviewed people active in migration and asylum related work and performed analysis on services and processes targeting asylum seekers and refugees. 
Desktop research about migration law and processes in Sweden
While most of the material in this section already been presented in the theory section some results are worth pointing out. The security and justness of the related formal and legal processes are hard to evaluate. It is possible (and likely) that there have been occasions where the asylum process legality been compromised. (Stern & Wikström, 2016)


In a documentary from 2016 Löfgren & Selo follows the young boy Ahmad as he goes through the Swedish asylum process. Again what is seen is long waiting times, few meetings with SMA, an unclear process, unclear conditions for getting asylum  and depression and distrust as a result. (SVT - Löfgren & Selo, 2016)


Together with the reporting from the radio program “Kaliber” which highlighted an uncertainty in what documents and information are included in an asylum evaluation document it would not be far fetched to believe that these factors could affect how the applicant perceives the justness of the process.
Participatory research
Engaging in Swedish Development Partner’s “language café” activity
Swedish development Partner (SDP) is a Swedish-based NGO working to aid people in need. In Sweden the arrange several activities for recently arrived refugees, asylum applicants in waiting for result and single arriving children.
The “language café” is one of these activities. The aim is to help first time Swedish speakers to practise through dialogue in a relaxed way. Volunteers sit down with a group of Swedish beginner speakers and talk around a subject, selected by either the volunteer or the group members. Every session is around one hour and it is an open activity where anyone can come and join. Some Swedish speaking skills are necessary to get the most out of the sessions however. 


It is a very natural dialogue driven way of practising a language and the social aspect of it seems to be quite important. When the volunteer and the group’s members connect through dialogue and trust is established, it was observed that the second half of the sessions led to more focus on the volunteer answering questions about Swedish society and public institutions processes.
The rate of returning participants was according to volunteers and staff quite high and several participants and volunteers knew each other. The event was held two days a week and even though volunteers shifted around in terms of what days they could be there and there was no official scheduling of volunteers it seemed structured and continuous. Continuous in the way that participants could come and get continuous connection with the same native speakers from week to week.


The volunteers reasons for volunteering was varied; some said that they just wanted to help, some had an interest in languages, some were student studying relevant subjects which benefitted from real world experience/interactions and others found that the discussions and interactions was the meaningful part for them.


Visiting Kontrapunkt
Kontrapunkt is a local independent NGO. They aim to work for human and asylum rights, social change and on a local scale create alternative social structures they want to see replicated in society. They do this by among other things having open activities such as “People’s kitchen” ( Sv.: “Folkköket”), a free meal for anybody who want. They arrange asylum help sessions where people applying for asylum can go and get answer to questions around the process and what other legal aids are available. They also have open nights where they open their locals for homeless people and a free shop where every item is free. They also have a varied range of workshop activities and open workspaces for its members. (Kontrapunkt volunteer introductory seminar, 2017)
Even though research through observation at the asylum help sessions were denied, citing ethical and trust establishing reasons, a couple of interesting notes came from the visit. Firstly food was expressed to be used very deliberately as a “means of activism”. The possibility with food was that it could act as a community building element and stimulate meetings between different people with different social background and standing. (Kontrapunkt volunteer introductory seminar, 2017)


A second note was their usage of a local alternative currency, called “Carma Capital” (Sv.: “Karma Kapital”). Whenever Kontrapunkt arrange club nights with music, dancing and alcoholic beverages they way to purchase drinks are done by first purchasing an amount of the local currency. As of writing this system has been limited in its usage to these events but the expressed goal was to connect this currency to the rest of the organisations activities. For example helping out in the kitchen could give you some “Carma Capital”. (Kontrapunkt volunteer introductory seminar, 2017)
The complexities of working with a local currency and the way such a system can influence and inspire social change is outside of the scope of this thesis. In the following section “Design process - Ideation” I will shortly discuss a concept around this and how it could benefit asylum applicants but this ultimately lies outside the scope and resource availability for a proper development and is discarded.


Taking introductory classes in migration law
The “Introduction to asylum and migration law” seminars were arranged by a student organisation called The Asylum Law Students (Sv. Asylrättstudenterna). Practising lawyers working with asylum and migration cases held the lectures on migration law terms and laws, european migration laws, the definition of refugees and much more. (Asylrättstudenterna - Introduction to asylum and migration law, 2017) Most of the legal aspects and how the processes work has already been presented in the background and theory sections. However, some very interesting reflection were made that I want to bring up.


The first reflection was about the constant stream of questions from clients about their cases. “We can spend 8h a day about our clients cases and if any progress has been made.” (Sait Umdi, Cityadvokaterna Malmö. 9/3-17) Since the evaluation can take up to half a year from the time the interview is completed practising lawyers in the field gets large amount of questions regarding to clients cases. The contact between SMA and the applicant in the asylum evaluation process where once again confirmed to be limited to a few occasions.
The reflections expressed in the ‘Introduction to migration law’-seminars together with the information received from interviews and desktop research, clearly indicates that the contact between SMA and the asylum applicants is lacking, either in its frequency, understandability, trust or contactability.


Another thing explicitly brought up was the interview situation itself and how hard it can be to adequately express their story. If a person is untrained in verbally expressing themselves then such a situation is unlikely to get a clear view over why that person need protection and what evidence there is for this. (Asylrättstudenterna - Introduction to asylum and migration law, 2017)
Additionally the person can possibly be traumatized, suffer from depression, have a inclination to not trust interpreters or have no trust in the evaluation process itself. These factors combined surely show a great danger of misinterpretation or misrepresentation of evidence.


Thirdly, the most common reason to deny asylum is that there is an option for internal refuge. This means that there are regions in the country that is being fleed that is safe for the applicant. Furthermore, most applicants that receive a negative decision appeal this. Even though in some cases there is no real possibility to have the decision reversed the applicants naturally want to explore every option there is. (Asylrättstudenterna - Introduction to asylum and migration law, 2017)
Structured and unstructured interviews
Interview with SMA
To understand more about the interview environment, the work process and the perspectives from a SMA case worker’s perspective I conducted a structured interview with a person working at the south region office. Most of the questions discussed in this interview have already been brought up earlier in the text but a discussion about what documents that could be presented as evidence by the applicant gave some interesting reflections. (Interview with SMA caseworker, 2017)
When the asylum applicant conduct their interview they can present any information they seem fit to prove their need for protection. For example a written letter from a teacher. However, since every case are evaluated individually the amount of evidence ascribed to these documents are also done on an individual basis. (Interview with SMA caseworker, 2017) This, coupled with the low frequency of meetings between case worker and applicant, would only make it seem naturally for a caseworker to overall give informal documents a relative weak evidence importance.


Interview with Swedish Development Partner
In addition to talking to SMA I also wanted to engage NGO’s. I interviewed Kornelia Tofani at SDP about their different activities but focused on their ‘Children in waiting’ activity. This is a group activity for parents and their children where they are separated into a parent’s group and a children's group. They then discuss events, thoughts and feelings in order to give support and help these people to cope with their situation. (Interview with SDP Tofani, 2017)


One season of the project also created a book called “We traveled here” (Sv. “Vi reste hit”). This small book collect two stories told and discussed at the meetings but they are fragments and made up of several different real stories. The end result is something very interesting, a therapeutic way of telling a personal story while at the same creating a feeling of that there are others that have gone through similar experiences. (BIV, 2012)

Figure X: Page from “We traveled here”


We also talked about the general working environment in an NGO, cooperation between different organisations, ability to influence processes regarding to migration, about how long waiting times can affect the legal certainty of the process and the importance of not being isolated and alone. (Interview with SDP Tofani, 2017)


Interview with Henrik Dalin, design lead IBM Interactive Experience 
2016 Dalin took initiative, in cooperation with the Swedish Red Cross, to create a common information platform for all Swedish Red Cross activities. The end user product is an app called “Virtual Volunteer” that present helpful information, maps, activities and locations in multiple different languages.It is aimed at both volunteers working in the field and refugees or other individuals who are in need of help and support. It is currently being rolled out in Sweden after a successful initial period in Greece. (Interview with Dalin, 2017)

Figure X: Screenshots from the “Virtual Volunteer” app


The interview was varied and unstructured but the focus was to understand better how it was to work as a designer in a NGO/refugee context and how much active user research that was conducted. In the development of “Virtual Volunteer” the contact with the user group was handled by the Red Cross and Dalin and his team took care of the technical aspects of development. (Interview with Dalin, 2017)
We also discussed some of my initial concepts for designs. One important point Dalin made was that a fundamental part of a design concept that is meant to support people in a specific situation is that it do this before, under and after the supported situation. (Interview with Dalin, 2017) It is much less helpful to have a tool that is contextually bound to a specific situation and that the applicant cannot use or get use to beforehand, than a service that they can explore and use under all different stages of the process.


Discussion touch upon the difficulty in that the NGO’s and technology/design industry have very different areas of expertise. NGO’s often lack the necessary competencies or/and funding to lead innovation projects (with exceptions of course.) and the tech/design industry have a tendency to simplify complex socio-economic and legislational problems. (Interview with Dalin, 2017)
Cooperation between several different NGOs in innovation development projects was also said to be difficult. (Interview with Dalin, 2017) Because of different goals, internal and external political issues, competing in funding, different ideologies, etc. While not explicitly discussed in the interview, the Red Cross for example, have several types of unified information platforms. Refugee Buddy (http://www.rodekruis.nl/refugeebuddy) and Refugee App (http://refugeeaidapp.com/) are a couple of examples of information platforms/portals with exactly the same goals and target users as Virtual Volunteer.
Benchmarking Swedish migration agency’s internet services
SMA have several sites to publish information and they do this in several different languages. 


Migrationsverket.se
This is the main site for the SMA. Here a person can apply for several different permits and visas, check the progress of their case and book a meeting with a caseworker. They also publish news and information about the different processes. The site is available in many different languages but the pages or information accessible in a specific language do vary. For example, Arabic and Russian only have specific information pages about certain areas, and even though the areas are the same the amount of information on them differ considerably. English have a complete translation except for the “Other operators” section, which is only available in Swedish. (Migrationsverket, 2017(3))

Figure X: Screenshots from Migrationsverket.se and the language select options.


Lifos
Lifos is SMA’s own database on legal data, country information and process guiding documents. This site is very important for asylum cases because it contains SMA’s internally created process guiding documents, so called “legal positions” (Sv. “Rättsliga ställningstaganden). Most data in Lifos is public but it do also include some restricted documents.


 Screen Shot 2017-05-06 at 23.28.47.png 

Figure X: Screenshot from Lifos main page


There is a detailed search functionality where a user can search with a lot of different parameters. Text search on title and descriptions, logic functionality (exclude words), keywords- country-  and source filtering, and date from and to.


 Screen Shot 2017-05-06 at 23.29.43.png 

Figure X: Screenshot from Lifos detailed search. The right hand side list shows different tags that are the most frequent used. The top keyword “Hela databasen” reveals that the whole database contains 12571 entries (7 may 2017).


Neither the site nor the documents presented on the site are translated. Many documents are written in Swedish only, some are only available in English and a few are written in German. There is no ‘help’ or ‘about’ that explains the content. It seems far fetched that this site is usable by a non-swedish speaker.
Some summaries are removed when the information gets outdated and replaced. This is very unfortunate. For example in an appeal information that has changed might need to be referred to. It’s then made needlessly hard for the applicant and their counsel to retrieve the information that was previously there. 
There is limited or no metadata accessible when it comes to popular searches, newly created tags, removal or replacement of documents etc. This is probably available internally but Lifos do not have a publicly available api to search through.


Basic usability problems are also present, for example only ten results on each page are possible and no alternative layout exist. The keywords can be unclear and duplicates exist. The search logic function interface (“Utan ord i titeln”/”Exclude word” and “Ord i titeln”/”Include word”) is needlessly separated into several input fields breaking against current normal search practises of having logic functions connected to + (plus-sign) and - (minus-sign). This contribute to the overall complexity of the whole interface.
Since this is the main way to access these documents, the accessibility of it is an important consideration. If the documents in Lifos can affect the asylum process (which is the explicit intent with these documents) then anyone involved in the process should have equal access to them. Even if a caseworker is meant to follow these guides, and even though the public counsel will have access and understand them, an inaccessibility to these documents can still decrease trust in the process.


Setelin
An innovation hackathon initiative arranged by Refugee Tech, Sthlm Tech and SMA led to the creation of Setel.in, a site for easy access to many different sources of information and applications. The purpose is to have new Swedes and people currently applying for visa/citizenship/asylum to simplify their introduction to the Swedish society. This site is at the time of writing available in Swedish, English and Arabic. (Setelin, 2016)


 Screen Shot 2017-05-07 at 00.35.26.png 

Figure X: Setelin start page


In a news post from 6th of September 2016 SMA says “Sweden first with new platform to assist migration and integration”. (Migrationsverket, 2016(2)) This is questionable in at least one way and objectively wrong in another. Setelin is an information portal site that lists links sorted in categories such as “information”, “social” and “employment”, and while the links provided are good and valid the accessibility is not. The translation of the site is limited to headlines only, i.e. the descriptions of the links are not translated. The links presented are also very limited and to varied to be of any real interest and no search functionality is present. To say that this platform “assist migration and integration” is very likely an all too strong expression.


Setelin is also not the first (digital) platform developed that aims to better integration and migration by collecting links. It is created by volunteers with technical skills and passion for helping, without any disclaimed funding from SMA. The reason to bring all this up is not really to discuss an underdeveloped application but instead shine a light on what type of project that SMA describes to be part of “social innovation”. (Migrationsverket, 2016(2)) 


Open data initiatives
SMA also publish some of their data under their ‘Open data’ initiative. The data available is the same as their published statistics documents but in the form of excel spreadsheets. The data, while usable and nicely formatted, is not very accessible. It access page is only available in Swedish while the documents are in Swedish and English (not completely translated however); SMA only include the latest data sets; and there is no api from which the data can be retrieved. While the data is open and available a better data interface/api would make it accessible.

Information about Sweden-website
Website providing information and links. Not run by SMA but supported financially. Often referred to as a good source for information for anyone new to the Swedish society. It is available in ten different languages and seems completely translated. Links outside the page is however for the most part linked to Swedish or English sites. It has information sorted in categories such as ‘Learn Swedish’ and ‘Care & Health’. There is also a slightly hidden section ‘New in Sweden’ that have information material about the different laws and processes relating to migration. Unfortunately these link mostly to SMA’s own site (again only to the English or Swedish variant since SMA’s site is not completely translated) or the links are broken all together and return a 404 site. (Information om Sverige, 2017)

Design trends and efforts from the tech community
In this section I did benchmarking on many different designs and types of concepts. The result was three categories that I deemed to be most interesting for the design process.


Information platforms
There have been many information platforms developed for use by refugees and volunteers. Some examples have already been presented above. The Refugee Aid app could be brought up as a positive example since it brings together several different NGO’s under one roof so to speak. Both the Red Cross and Doctors without borders for example have information published on that platform. (http://refugeeaidapp.com/)


Gray from UNHCR Innovation brings up several problems with such platforms. The article do not discuss this category only but the problems I want to highlight are very prominent in this category. Distrust from the user base is very common and refugees tend to want information from volunteers directly. (Gray, 2016) Since information in this design space is highly volatile and prone to change this is not surprising.
Another problem touched upon by Gray is the duplication of concepts. (Gray, 2016) Since design efforts are not coordinated but instead often stem from personal initiatives duplication is to be expected. But this lead to wasted development time and fractured information. The last consequence is ultimately contra-productive when the end goal is a collected portal for information.


One very interesting service currently under development is a chatbot for asylum seekers. The Guardian writes about it that it’s using Facebook Messanger as the basis for its functionality: "The 20-year-old chose Facebook Messenger as a home for the latest incarnation of his robot lawyer because of accessibility. “It works with almost every device, making it accessible to over a billion people,” he said." (Guardian, 2017)
The same developer also created the “Do Not Pay” chatbot. (http://www.donotpay.co.uk) This has helped 160000 British citizens to appeal their parking fines. (Guardian, 2017) This type of information providing is very interesting with a lot of potential for reaching out to people not willing to browse arbitrarily bureaucratic governmental websites.


Communication/Networking tools
Refugees welcome (http://www.refugees-welcome.net/) is an initiative to match refugees with another person that can share their apartment or in other ways can provide accommodation. This initially created a lot of attention. But as of writing the number of matches made is only 936 total world wide. The Swedish branch has matched 51 total from autumn 2015. (http://www.refugees-welcome.net/) (https://refugees-welcome.se/) 
Gray writes about Refoodgee, an app to connect refugees and locals by cocking together. Slow updates and a small user base is again a result of coordination and lack of collaboration between the humanitarian and tech sectors. (Gray, 2016)


Ruben Pater writes 2016 a critical post regarding the “What design can do” design competition and the tendency by the industry to push design thinking as a universal problem solver.
"By emphasising the problem-solving capabilities of design, the WDCD Refugee Challenge supports the idea that the free market is much better at solving the world's crises than governments are. Design may be able to come up with clever products or enlightening ideas, but only governments and NGOs can provide refugees with the resources, infrastructure, and laws that are needed in the long run.” (Pater, 2016)
He continues:
“It is also absurd to suggest that design can come up with solutions for a crisis that is political and socio-economic at heart." (Pater, 2016)


Translation aids
A number of different apps are used to perform translation of phrases. These are in scope more focused than previous categories and are therefore not as susceptible to the problems raised above The access to a smartphone is (to an extent) ubiquitous and applications like Google Translate are very commonly used to translate phrases and words.
There is also designs like the ‘ICOON For Refugees’, a book with illustrations and commonly used icons to be used by refugees and volunteers in order to facilitate communication. The project was crowdfunded and released a free app. (Amberpress, 2015)

The images are ordered in categories such as health, accommodation and travel. No information around adoption rate of this design or its effectiveness have been found but similar illustrative tools are used in healthcare for making preliminary diagnosis. 
Ideation
Design principles
As a result of the exploration phase I created three design principles. These principles would guide my choice of concept and how to develop that concept. 


  

Figure X: Design principles


1. Aim to increase trust in the asylum process
2. Should support the applicant before, under and after the interview evaluation
3. Must give any possible advantage to the applicant
Service blueprint
For a complete overview of the asylum process as a service I made a simple service blueprint. This is by no means the complete picture but helped the work when discussing the before, under and after design principle.


  

Figure X: Simple service map. The evaluation interview is marked out. 
Opportunities and initial concepts
Based on what the purpose of this work was, i.e including asylum seekers better in the asylum evaluation process to establish trust, the initial concepts that could come from this were many. There where in particular a couple of examples that I originally saw as feasible and used as examples in contact with organisations and institutions.


Direct translation as control mechanism for caseworker
A first concept was created with the goal of giving the case worker some sort of control mechanism to possibly identify problems in translation. The idea was to have a computer analyzing the applicants words and if specific keywords were found these were going to show up on the caseworkers monitor. If the interpreter would not mention anything related to the keyword, then either the interpreter misunderstood the applicant or the computer analysed the word in a wrong way. If the subject discussed was of a delicate type, for example homosexuality, then the caseworker could ask the interpreter to ask the question in different words to get a better and (hopefully) more trustfull understanding. 


  

Figure X: Illustration of keyword translation concept


This was discarded because of the fact that it was meant to aid the caseworker. In discussions with NGO workers and legal guardians the issue of weighting the process was brought up. Anything or any tool that can drive decisions in a specific direction should only be made to give any possible advantage to the asylum applicant. A concept that can be used only or mainly by a SMA caseworker could be ethically very difficult to design since the use of such a tool and the initiative to act on the result of the tool would be completely up to the caseworker.
Also from a service design perspective this concept would fail to create a better service for the service consumer. It could not create a more just process. The issue lies in the trust between interpreter and applicant that repeatedly is pointed out to lead to the applicant not revealing important personal details. The asylum applicant, the service consumer, need to present evidence for their need for protection. 


There were also practical difficulties with developing such a tool. Access to the specific interview room, testing it with caseworkers etc.


Icon book for asylum interview 
This concept took a lot of inspiration from the “ICOON for refugees” book and other such concepts but would have targeted the icon set towards the interview situation. There are certain words/concepts/ideas that are hard to explain in some languages and a icon map showing these concepts could be helpful.


This concept would have several flaws but the two most important was that it would not establish more trust since iconography also need to be interpreted and the concepts that are difficult to address with words may very well be difficult to express in abstracted icons/illustrations. Additionally this would not be useful before or after the interview situation and would thus break from my design principles.


Better search of country information and decision guiding documents
The third concept was aimed directly at the asylum seekers and the public counsels, volunteers and other contact people helping them. If the data in Lifos was accessible through an API a third party search functionality could be built around it that was better suited towards usages by the applicants themselves. This could be further leveraged by incorporating machine translation of the summaries so that a larger group of users could understand what the different documents were about.


  

Figure X: Translation of Lifos documents


In addition to search functionality the concept also allows for the creation of lists. These lists can then be downloaded, stored, shared or printed. The concept should also stored summaries and documents deleted in Lifos as a secure reference (noting that they’ve been replaced of course).


The concept was selected to be the best concept in accordance with the design guideline as defined above. It can be used before the evaluation interview to find evidence and understand the process better. In the interview a list can be handed over to the interviewer as evidence and after it will be helpful to reference if Lifos removes any of their summaries. It is firmly targeted at the applicant and the support individuals working with the applicant and it is stipulated that transparency and understanding of a process increase trust in it.
Decided direction of continued design work
While doing participating research and desktop research it became clear that there were a couple of notable problems in regards to the praxis guiding documents. Lack of accessible data were deemed as a potential weak point when it comes to establishing trust in the migration process. Lifos also removes outdated/replaced data posts, this could potentially undermine the legality of the process.


Even though the summaries and documents in Lifos are written in a formal language the concept would enable applicants to be more aware of the documents that guide the process. This in turn could also support applicants to bring a list of the documents to include in the evaluation. Since the quality assessment discussed above questioned if these Lifos documents are included consistently in evaluations, then any tool that aid an applicant in the selection and understanding of these documents helps the process’ legally justness.


The concept direction taken was one that focused on the accessibility of Lifos data, storing it externally and translating it. 
Prototype
Translation service
One of the bigger focus points in making land information data more accessible for the different stakeholders was to have some form of translation in place. Since the concept needed to go through and parse thousands of smaller summaries and larger documents this could not be done by hand. Based on the current asylum seeker's country of origin (and the availability of Arabic speaking testers) the used language translation service needed to provide fair translation of Swedish to English, Swedish to standard Arabic and English to standard Arabic. It also needed to be easy to use and not expensive.


Mistranslations make the use of machine translation in situation when clear and concise communication is needed very difficult. On a prototype level and in the intended use case where the search is used to get an initial understanding of the content it is believed to be of lesser consequence.
Structure
The concepts main structure is basically four different parts but the goal was to create a user interface that increased accessibility to Lifos data. Because of this goal we needed to first be able to extract data from Lifos or in some other way search through it. The two alternatives were to either build an interface on top of existing Lifos search functionality or to download the data to a custom database. Because of advantages in real-time searchability, a possibility of custom metadata, one-time translations and complete control over the data set, the second alternative was adopted.
        Because of this approach the server facing side of the concept needed three parts. A database, a crawler which iterated the Lifos database and downloaded the relevant data and a translation functionality. In the end the translation was done with cloud functions for proper separation of purpose between the different programs and more efficient crawl functionality.


  

Figure X: Program suite overview


Based on the prototypes need for a database, translation service, and hosting, the Google platform Firebase was selected. It contains all the functions needed and several features that make development easier. It is also scalable, affordable and connect directly with the Google Cloud Services that perform translation.


  

Figure X: Example of console log messages from crawler


  

Figure X: Stored data hierarchy example
Interface
The interface was kept as simple as possible. This was deliberately done to identify the minimal amount of functionality needed for such a concept. It was also made to aid accessibility for different language speakers, unaccustomed computer users and mobile users.


  

Figure X: First wireframe of the client search interface


A few exceptions was made while building the first prototype. The search button was removed to keep the layout as uncluttered as possible. The layout for the result items was simplified and I also included the source and publication data under the title. The ‘tags found’ was also removed.


  

Figure X: Client page prototype


Since the search page was hosted live on the internet I added a info icon (top left) that when clicked present some information about the project, a useage and data disclaimer notice and a contact email address.
  

Figure X: Comparison of Lifos detailed search and simplified search
Evaluation
A first round of testing tried to validate the general layout and affordance of the interface elements. Directly following the testing an unstructured discussion around the prototype was performed. Three testers total were recruited, with different levels of understandings about the design context. I used Norman’s seven principles of design to assess the user’s perceived overall usability. After this the aims of the concept and its intended use cases were explained and the testers could comment on this as well. 
Results from first tests
The search functionality was found to be understandable. No one said anything about the “search”-button missing and had found the keywords easy to put in. However, the appearance likeness to Google’s “omni”-search–”type anything in this box and we find it”-search–created the same affordance in the testers. This seemed to make the keyword-only search slightly more confusing than necessary.
Sorting of result items was questioned. The prototype was expected (and intended) to sort the items on date with the most recent posts higher up. Unfortunately the placing of results was inconsistent and mixed up. Sorting on relevance was requested as was sorting out sources outside of SMA’s own documents.


Comparisons between Lifos search functionality and the prototype gave different responses depending on the testers previous understanding of the area and previous contact with these documents. Testers with pre-existing knowledge about the system said that Lifos own search included more search functions for finding relevant information. These two testers also understood the keyword search faster. The tester without pre-existing knowledge did not find Lifos search functionality helpful, rather intimidating and confusing. 
Some smaller feedback regarded how links should open in a new window was also expressed. Else overall, when asked to explain the interface, the testers seemed to have understood the different elements of the interface and what they could do without too much problem.


After the initial questions and feedback a use case and explanation was presented to the testers and they were asked to comment on this. The presented use case was that if an applicant do not have a public counsel then this concept could be a tool for both applicant and their legal guardian/contact person in finding, communicating and reference the Lifos documents.
The tester with pre-existing knowledge wanted to see three things to properly be able to use the concept. They needed the complete database to be available, more languages to cover more diverse asylum applicants and better sorting functions.
Prototype iteration
Based on the results from the first tests it was decided to develop the prototype and focusing again on the usability of the interface. The keywords under every result (that was in the first wireframe but not in the prototype) were added. The wording in the search frame was changed, from “Search here” to only “Keyword”, and suggestion text was added at the side (“Suggested keywords: Afghanistan, Women, Practise”).
        The links are instead of opening directly in the same window, which would make so that users lost their search session, was replaced by having them open in a new tab/window. An common “open externally” icon was added to indicate this fact.
Final concept
The final concepts main change was the inclusion of a document list for storing specific results. It also include better discoverability of keywords and a slightly clearer layout than the first prototype.

To many languages would make it difficult to switch between them effectively. Therefore only five are represented here. There is probably a workaround with introducing customization into the concept and the ability to select which languages the user want to see. No such feature have been incorporated in this version however.

A user can now click on the ‘add to list’ icon and store a specific document in the ‘document list’. The aim of the ‘document list’ functionality is to allow both applicant and counsel to store evidence/information references in a functional way for future reference. It could also be printed and given to the caseworker in the evaluation interview. How these printouts should be designed has not been completed but it is possible that a “Include as evidence”-stamp could be present.
        Even while the list is open the language selectors are still clickable so even within the list a user can switch back and forth between languages.

Keyword discoverability is enhanced by showing suggestions while the user types in letters.
