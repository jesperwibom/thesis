Introduction
The right to asylum is a human right. ("Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution." - The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN, 1948) How the persecution is supposed to be evaluated however is quite complex. A work like I propose would strive to give some humble contribution to this evaluation process. Not only that, using interaction design methods together with social-, language- and cultural studies bring in knowledge about a group of people that is mostly unrecognised in the technology industry that we so often limit our design work to.


Refugees seeking asylum in Sweden needs to have his/her refugee status evaluated by a caseworker. The asylum seeker is called for an interview with the case worker and whether the refugee status is accepted or not accepted is largely based on this. If need for protection is deemed to be proven the asylum seeker is granted asylum in Sweden. The evaluation largely builds upon the refugee status evaluation interview and this situation often needs an interpreter. Communication is more often than not quite difficult.
There are two large problems with the Swedish refugee status evaluation process. (1) It is not fast enough: because of high demand or other limitations the waiting time is directly hazardous for refugee seekers and delay their ability to support themselves. (2) The evaluation is mainly grounded in a very complex interview in which small nuances in interpretation can have large consequences on the final decision.
Deliminations
As stated above it is my intention to explore the situation and process of the evaluation interview. This because of a couple reasons. (a) The refugee status evaluation interview is where a case is started. (b) In addition to this it is one of few times when the asylum seeker meets their case worker. (c) Because the situation often demands an interpreter to be present the communication can be complex. (d) Also there is a opposing nature in this situation; one side (the asylum seeker) tasked with proving their need for asylum and the other side (the caseworker / Swedish Migration Agency) trying to evaluate if it is true or not, i.e. trying to disprove the story told by the asylum seeker.
My focus is to create a design with high usability that is tailored to the specific situation. The experiential quality in the interview situation is taken to be trust between stakeholders. Therefore a positive design result would be one that increase trust between the parties.
The design should not take focus away from the interview. It should enhance the meeting between the reefuge and the handler, increase communication and understanding, not deduct from that experience. This might limit how much impact such a tool might make. This is also to do with the ethical implications of introducing any tool that could potentially influence the outcome. Furthermore, the fact that many of the main stakeholders suffer some form of trauma must be well understood when conducting any participatory research. Regardless, this perspective must be accounted for in the whole work process including the finished result.
Also to be aware of is the fact that going through the refugee evaluation process takes time and in this time these individual will often experience more stress and anxiety. This is both a difficulty for the research as it is a subject for it. This fact makes it very complicated and being very careful is written on the wall. It is to note that the main difficulty needed to overcome in interviews with stakeholder share many similarities with the design situation.
Design process overview
The design process model will be arranged in three main parts; the discovery phase, the design phase and the delivery phase. The discovery phase is preparation of experiments, contact creation, preliminary interviews and finding some first design direction.
After that the design phase take over. This is where I do more extensive field work, interviews and other studies to ground my current design direction. I will then use prototyping together with other forms of testing to validate the result. This may, or may not, generate new directions and reveal new opportunities which will be handled in another iteration of the design phase. This is repeated as many times as seem appropriate.
The last stage is the delivery phase. In this I will bring together the learnings made from the design phase, analyse the result and identify future design directions within the design space.
The design phase of the work is a quick but iterative process, it will therefore take up most of the time. To keep track of where I am in the project I will write a progress report or reflection each week. This can be used both by me alone to keep track of where I am in the iterative design process. It can also be used in the meetings with my supervisor to communicate and get feedback on current design efforts and methods.
Goals and aims
With this work I want to do two things: (1) explore the context/situation of the refugee status evaluation interview using interaction design methods (see below) to reveal specific problems and opportunities, in the beginning focusing on–but not presumptuously limiting it to–accuracy in interpretation / the understanding between the asylum seeker and the case worker. I will then (2) design tools for overcoming these problem / taking advantage of these opportunities.

Background
Global refugee situation and its effect on Swedish migration policies
The Swedish process for applying and being granted asylum is complex. In recent years, 2015-2016 especially, the number of people applying for asylum in EU countries has gone up markedly. (Eurostat, 2017) 2015 statistics from UNHCR show 65 million people displaced by war and persecution, the highest numbers ever recorded. This means that globally 1 in every 113 people "...is now either a refugee, an asylum-seeker or internally displaced". (UN News Center, 2016) More than 50% of all refugees comes from only three countries: Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia but asylum applications in EU come from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. (UNHCR, 2016) (Eurostat Press Office, 2016) 2015 also saw European Union register 1.2 million first time asylum seekers, double the year before. From this 156 110 asylum applications were registered in Sweden. (Eurostat Press Office, 2016)
This has strained the european countries ability to process asylum applications. Swedish Migration Agency's (from here on called SMA) own quality report confirms that the average waiting time increased from 237 days 2015 to 500 days 2016. (Migrationsverket, 2017(1)) This increase in asylum applications and wait times (and–I think it's fair to say–together with national political pressure to decrease immigration overall) led to a new law regarding accepting asylum applications. From the 24 of November 2015 the new law changed the previous praxis of granting permanent residence permit to people with refugee status or subsidiary protection status to a temporary residence permit.(SFS 2017123) The new law also severely limits the possibility for family reunification. (Migrationsinfo, 2017)


The 12th of November 2015 Sweden starts a temporary internal border control and the 4th of January 2016 Sweden and Denmark have both control of valid identification as well as internal border control. (Øresundsinstituttet, 2017) Just like the new law these actions are temporary. The new law is only valid for 3 years and the id- and border control must be renewed every six months. (SFS 2017123)(SFS 20151073) There is shown to be an 88% decrease of first time asylum applicants in Sweden between the third quarter 2015 and the third quarter 2016. (Eurostat, 2017) These numbers reflect the increased difficulty in moving inside the European Union countries. (Migrationsinfo, 2016)
Even though the number of asylum applications has gone down from 2015 the waiting times have spiked. The temporary residence permits for people with subsidiary protection status will also need to be renewed every 13 months. SMA currently has taken no decision on to what extent these cases will need to be re-reviewed. (Interview with SMA case worker, 2017) Regardless of this coming re-evaluation process, the SMA is under a heavy workload and the slow process of getting even a temporary residence permit affect the asylum seekers mental health and well-being. Especially amongst children and young people coming to Sweden on their own. (SVT Nyheter, 2016)


A young person fleeing from war and persecution, have traveled through Europe under harsh conditions, come to the final destination just to be meet by a extremely slow bureaucratic process. Often this process takes years and even if the result is residence permit this is temporary. The person is again requested to renew their application every 13 months. The evaluation needs to achieve legal certainty and therefore the processing takes time. But the process create so much uncertainty that mental health problems are triggered, if not also created. Case workers at SMA are also affected by a prolonged process, and SMAs own report show that many of them say that they have been exposed to some form of pressure to grant/deny asylum. (Migrationsverket, 2016)
