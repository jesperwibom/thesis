Abstract
In this work, an alternative search functionality for the Swedish Migration Agency’s land information database is designed, prototyped and tested. By using machine translation, keyword filter search, and a simplified interface design, it attempts to give asylum seekers and their representatives a better tool to finding process guiding documentation. It is argued that the increased transparency of these documents can have a positive effect on the understanding of the asylum process. This, in turn, can protect individuals from unfair or arbitrary rulings, increase trust, and can create more engagement and participation in the asylum application process.
This work also critically explore the area of asylum in Sweden from a design perspective. It builds upon design politics and service design and discusses current trends relating to refugees, design, and technology. What is found is an unfortunate gap in knowledge areas between humanitarian organizations and the design/technology industry.


Keywords: asylum, design politics, machine translation, open data, accessibility,

I want to thank my supervisor Anuradha Venugopal Reddy for helping me find the right path when I lead myself astray. I also want to thank my awesome colleges at Topp for being fine with me going back to school for a while. Thanks to all my teachers that made a bigger impression on me than they might know. And thanks to my awesome classmates, I don’t know if I would have made it without you guys. <3


PS: Mom and dad, I love you!
