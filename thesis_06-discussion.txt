Discussion
"It’s no wonder that design is so often viewed as a self-aggrandizing profession. The model also assumes that the insight acquired by empathizing gives The Designer sufficient understanding to define and resolve The Other’s problems—even the world’s problems." (Wendt, 2017)


In an article from 2015 called 'Direct Response: How Tech Is Aiding The European Refugee Crisis' Neal Ungerleider writes on FastCompany.com–a magazine and web page about progressive and innovation in business–regarding the high numbers of refugees and how NGOs are using social media and e-commerce services to coordinate and communicate. "[they] are turning to social media and other novel tech methods to assist those in need." (Ungerleider, 2015) This is quite true but should not be surprising.
The article, written with good intentions no doubt, epitmoizes the tech industry's preoccupation with thinking 'it' changes the world. It is naive and does not begin to cover the multitude of difficulties meeting refugees, volunteers, health professionals, migration workers and NGO's on a daily basis. The only thing that is happening is that communication services are being used by these people. The fact that some of its users are refugees do not implicitly mean that the companies running these services are helping refugees.


Ruben Pater acknowledge that the industries naive views can be one of insensitive communication. But he also notes that "WDCD says the refugee crisis is a global challenge too big for governments and NGOs alone, positioning design as the ultimate problem-solving discipline in a way that coincides with the narrative of neoliberal European policies." (Pater, 2016)


Still, people try their best to come up with better tools and services for vulnerable people in dire need. But the resulting design is under great risk to either miss what the users needs are, how the design is affected by the political practises by host countries, or not adequately promoting its usage. One such example can be said to be quick-houses for refugee camps, from such companies as IKEA. The design allows for a house to be constructed in a day but misunderstand the need for such housing. It is true that refugee camps need better living conditions, but it is also true that many temporary camps are older than ten years. Quick houses then misunderstands the geo-political difficulties that have stranded thousands of refugees and stops them from moving on.
Refugees are by definition in transit, on their way to shelter, and even though the reality more often than not don't reflect this (Calais, any african refugee camp) it can be quite tricky to find the correct channels in which information may live and can spread. Information needs to be updated constantly and if no update is made it should be controlled and marked as controlled. This because of the large data sets of outdated information already present.


There seems to be missing a large set of knowledge in the tech/design industry when it comes to migration and asylum. This is further enhanced by the fact that not many development and innovation projects has been initialized by NGOs or other institutions. And lastly, what refugees need from a service perspective is sometimes contradictory to governmental processes and law praxis.
One approach is to embrace the thinking in design politics, presented above, to help designer exercise introspection. To understand where oneself come from, the socio-economic background and one’s cultural heritage. This is made explicit and differences between designer and user can be overcome, if not beneficiary. Participatory research deepens the understanding of the design context and service design can the be used to bring in an holistic approach over a larger area.
Take aways from design process
Some reflections on the design process. It is apparent that while working hard to create connections and participating in different activities the work went to long in the exploratory phase and as a result did not complete enough iterations. When approaching the different actors, such as NGO’s and SMA, it is helpful to have examples, sketches or rough prototypes. 
Another factor that was given a lot of consideration under the whole development phase was to not create something harmful. To not follow the industry saying of “fail fast”. “Failing” in an ethically complicated context might not be such a good idea but I should have allowed myself to fail more while developing the prototype.
